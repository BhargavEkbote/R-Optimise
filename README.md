### The Replacement
Don't trust anyone claming to represent RCO, they are more than likely attempting to mislead you.<br>
<br>
The only recommended replacement for RCO is Bloxstrap, created by a passionate team of developers, who I can guarantee, know what they're doing, and know as much about FFlags as I do.

### Final Goodbyes
Thank you to everyone who supported the RCO project, but it's time for me to get on with my life, away from the limelight and away from Roblox.
<br>
<br>
I'll see you on the other side.
